## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Custom Fields Not Appearing
**Problem**: Custom fields not showing on standard doctypes

**Solution**:
```bash
bench --site your-site-name migrate
bench --site your-site-name clear-cache
```

#### 2. Progress Percentages Not Updating
**Problem**: Percent purchased/delivered not updating

**Solution**:
- Ensure related documents are submitted (not just saved)
- Check that documents have `custom_job_record` field populated
- Verify document events are firing (check server logs)

#### 3. Items Not Fetching from Job Record
**Problem**: Purchase Order not auto-populating items

**Solution**:
- Ensure Job Record has items in the items table
- Check that Job Record is linked in Purchase Order
- Verify client script is loaded (check browser console)

#### 4. Duplicate Property Setter Error
**Problem**: Error during migration about duplicate property setter

**Solution**:
- Check `fixtures/property_setter.json` for duplicates
- Remove duplicate entries
- Re-run migration

#### 5. Missing Custom Field Error
**Problem**: Error about unknown column in database

**Solution**:
- Ensure custom field exists in `fixtures/custom_field.json`
- Run migration to create missing fields
- Check that field is in correct doctype

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Server Logs**:
```bash
bench --site your-site-name logs
```

2. **Check Browser Console**: For client-side script errors

3. **Verify Fixtures**:
```bash
bench --site your-site-name console
```
Then in console:
```python
import frappe
frappe.get_all('Custom Field', filters={'module': 'KSA Logistics'})
```

4. **Clear Cache**:
```bash
bench --site your-site-name clear-cache
bench restart
```

2. **Use Quotations**: Create quotations first, then create Job Records from them for better data consistency

3. **Update Status**: Regularly update Job Record status to reflect current state

4. **Review Reports**: Use built-in reports to monitor job progress and financials

5. **Backup Data**: Regular backups before major operations
